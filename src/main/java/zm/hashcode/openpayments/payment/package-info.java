/**
 * Payment API client services for the Open Payments Java SDK.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package and its sub-packages contain API client services for payment-related operations. These services make
 * HTTP requests to Open Payments resource servers to create, retrieve, and manage payment resources.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Important:</strong> These services do not process or execute payments. They communicate with Open Payments
 * API servers (operated by Account Servicing Entities) which handle the actual payment processing.
 *
 * <h2>Sub-packages</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link zm.hashcode.openpayments.payment.incoming} - Incoming payment API operations</li>
 * <li>{@link zm.hashcode.openpayments.payment.outgoing} - Outgoing payment API operations</li>
 * <li>{@link zm.hashcode.openpayments.payment.quote} - Quote API operations</li>
