## What's Been Configured

Your Open Payments Java SDK now has a professional-grade build system with automatic code formatting and quality checks.

### ✅ Automatic Code Formatting (Spotless)

**No more manual formatting!** Code is automatically formatted during build:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Removes unused imports
- ✅ Organizes imports by package
- ✅ Fixes indentation (4 spaces)
- ✅ Removes trailing whitespace
- ✅ Ensures consistent brace formatting
- ✅ Adds newlines at end of files

**Manual formatting command:**
```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

### ✅ Code Quality Checks

**Active Tools:**
1. **Spotless** - Auto-formats code before compilation
2. **Checkstyle** - Enforces Java coding standards
   - Line length: 120 characters
   - Method length: 150 lines max
   - Parameter count: 7 max
   - Naming conventions
   - Import rules
   - Code structure best practices

**Disabled (Java 25 compatibility):**
- PMD - Will be enabled when Java 25 support is added
- SpotBugs - Will be enabled when Java 25 support is added

### 🚀 How It Works

When you run `./gradlew build`:
1. Spotless **automatically formats** all Java files
2. Code is **compiled** with strict linting enabled
3. Checkstyle **verifies** code quality standards
4. Tests run
5. Build artifacts are created

**If formatting or quality checks fail, the build fails!** This prevents poorly formatted or buggy code from being committed.

### 📝 Commands You'll Use

```bash
# Standard build (does everything)
./gradlew build

# Clean build
./gradlew clean build

# Just format code
./gradlew spotlessApply

# Check code quality
./gradlew check

# Run specific checks
./gradlew checkstyleMain
```

### 📁 Configuration Files

```
config/
├── checkstyle/
│   └── checkstyle.xml          # Checkstyle rules
├── pmd/
│   └── ruleset.xml             # PMD rules (for future use)
└── spotbugs/
    └── excludeFilter.xml       # SpotBugs exclusions (for future use)
```

### 🎯 Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All code follows the same style
2. **Automation**: No manual formatting needed
3. **Quality**: Catches bugs and style issues early
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Build fails on violations
5. **Team Productivity**: No time wasted on formatting debates

## Comparison with Maven

| Feature | Maven | This Gradle Setup |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Auto-format on compile | ✅ (with plugins) | ✅ Built-in |
| Style checking | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bug detection | ✅ | ✅ (disabled for Java 25) |
| Fast incremental builds | ❌ | ✅ |
| Build cache | ❌ | ✅ |
| Parallel execution | Limited | ✅ Full support |
| Configuration | XML | Kotlin DSL (type-safe) |

**Result**: More powerful and flexible than Maven, with better performance! 🚀
