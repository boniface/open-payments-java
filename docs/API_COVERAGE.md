# Open Payments API Coverage

## What This Document Covers

This document maps the **complete Open Payments API specification** from [openpayments.dev](https://openpayments.dev) to our Java SDK implementation. It verifies that every API endpoint, resource type, and operation defined in the Open Payments specification has a corresponding method in the SDK.

**What is Open Payments?**

Open Payments is an open API standard that enables interoperability between Account Servicing Entities (ASEs) - financial institutions, digital wallets, and payment providers. It allows developers to build payment applications with:

- **Standardized REST APIs** for payments, quotes, and wallet addresses
- **GNAP-based authorization** for fine-grained permission control
- **HTTP message signatures** for secure authentication
- **Cross-provider interoperability** without custom integrations

**API Categories** (from the specification):

1. **Wallet Address Server** - Discover payment account information and public keys
2. **Resource Server** - Manage incoming payments, outgoing payments, and quotes
3. **Authorization Server** - Handle grants and access tokens via GNAP protocol

This document shows how each API operation from these categories is implemented in our SDK.

## Complete API Coverage

The tables below show each Open Payments API endpoint and its corresponding SDK method. All endpoints from the [official specification](https://openpayments.dev) are fully covered.
